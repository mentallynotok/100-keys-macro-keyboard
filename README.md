## Story
So about 3 months ago I feel into a deep deep deep deeppppppppp rabit hole about mechanical keyboard. It was bad... I would just look at mechanical keyboard instead of doing importain things. I'd always want to buy a new mechanical keyboard. Thankfully I didn't buy any largely because my budget at the time was like 50$, and alot of the keyboard I want was about 150$+. And I was like I'm sure I can DIY myself a keyboard, but I looked at the pcb designing process and I was just like "NO", it was crazy but that isn't the end of my DIY keyboard arc.

Within like a month later I came across this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZEoss4XIgc) from LTT, where Taran the editor for LTT show of his insane 3 keyboard of macro setup just neuron activated "I need that... Not actually..." SPOILERS: I did not decide to make it at that point. So a couple of weeks went by and this insane 3 100% keyboard about 300 keys macro setup just won't leave my head and I decided to look for a macro keyboard. And alot of them where just boring 9 - 40 keys macropad, it was boring but then I found this (blog post)[https://relivesight.com/projects/433/] and it just change my whole world. It look insane and it was beautiful, and it also solve the pcb designing process because this the whole project was handwired "awesome!" I said to myself, and then right after that "how?" I thought the blog post doesn't give any info on how did the person do it so I just google how to make a handwired keyboard and this showup [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjml-K-pV4E&t) and boom the how problem is checked out. So there's only one thing to do make the damn thing.

## Theme/Keyswitch
Originally, I was going to go with the gateron yellow switch it cheap and I don't want to spent to much money . And then I saw this beauty


![The Dareu VioletGold V2](https://www.maxgaming.com/bilder/artiklar/zoom/21126_4.jpg?m=1646303161)

It's so beautiful (eventhough you're not gonna see it in the final keyboard*) And that is what inspire me for the theme of this keyboard a vtuber Ninomae Ina'nis her color scheme would work beautifully with this switch. And I bought 49,26$ worth of switches for a total of 135 switches great already over budget :D.

## Layout

The layout of my keyboard is not complicated it's

Here's the raw data that you can paste on http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/ 

[{a:7},"","","","","",{x:1.25},"","","","",""],

## Case/Plate 
For those who don't know mechanical keyboard usually have a plate that the keyboard sit on, then a pcb which will all be contain in a case wow verycool. for plates I have ordered a laser cut piece of acrylic pretty cool stuff. You can generate a DXF file by using (this site) [http://builder.swillkb.com/] and paste in the raw data that I have provided above

And then the case I go in blender wip up a quick* (3 week) 3d printable case that have a dedicated USB-C port already cut out

There's an STL file so you can 3d print it if you're interested

I'm still waiting for my parts to arrive so I'll update you when the parts are all here.
